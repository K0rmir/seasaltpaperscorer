<!-- // playerCount = 2 / 3 / 4 - This is chosen by the user via an input which updates the playerCount state. Depending on the choice it will render the corresponding component for the number of players. 

// then depending on playerCount state, the totalGameScore players will play to is determined. 

// if (playerCount = 2) {
//  let totalGameScore = 40
// } elif (playercounter =3) {
//  let totalGameScore = 35
// } else totalGameScore = 30

// at the end of each round the user will input the scores for each player. These scores will be added on to their total which will update each players score count. 

// A condition will be needed that checks if a player score is >= totalGameScore. If so, that player wins and the game ends. 

// 3 different components needed? 

// 1 for 2 player game, 1 for 3 player game, 1 for 4 player game.

// each one would have one more player state and input field to update their score.  -->
